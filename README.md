#  Secret World Of ONES&ZEROES #

## WWDC20 ##

In my Swift playground, I mainly use two frameworks UIKit and AVFoundation. I use the UI components in UIKit to construct an interactive interface that allows the users of the playground to learn what is binary and what is ASCII Code, how to convert decimal to binary, how to use ASCII Table to translate the information in binary, how to quickly solve problems with functions. Using AVFoundation to achieve audio output, enhance the user's interactive feeling. First, the playground introduces what is ASCII Code, then uses an interactive animation to introduce what is binary, how to convert binary to decimal, and finally uses a function to quickly convert a large string of binary into a string. At the end of Playground, there was a surprise. I hope the reader â€™s iPad has setting "Hey Siri". I used the bug that Siri could not recognize the electronic sound, so that I can use a piece of audio to call out Siri of any Apple device and simulate the computer has controlled the Apple. In the playground, I also used my little painting experience and drew a few pictures to make the readers feel more involved in the playground.
