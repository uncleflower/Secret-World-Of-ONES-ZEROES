 # Count Beans Game
 ----
 You first used a handful of beans to simulate how the denary is counted.ğŸ¥™

 Very simple, every ten.ğŸ™Œ

 So you want to use beans to simulate how octonary,quaternary and binary is counted.ğŸ¤˜

 After several bean experiments, you seem to understand what binary is.ğŸ¤”

 Let's do a test: what is 0111 1111 plus one?ğŸ¤¯
